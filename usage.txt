# Sets up 0.out, with one sequence -- the empty sequence. Include its hash.
# Also sets up each single instruction sequence in the appropriate files, with their hashes.
# Also writes an empty optimizations.out

> ./enumerator 20
# Read optimizations.out into a tree.
# Run radix sort to sort out/20.out by hash.
# For each instruction sequence in 20.out, compare with instruction sequences in
# 0.out or 20.out with the same hash and lower cost. Write any pairs that are the same to optimizations.out.
# If the instruction sequence did not have an optimization, append each possible instruction to it and write the
# results to the appropriate files, ignoring any that have a possible optimization.
